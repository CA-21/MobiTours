<h3>Culture of D.R. Congo</h3>
<p>
The culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reflects the diversity of hundreds of inhabiting the ethnic groups and their customs. The mouth of the river (Bas-Congo) successive dense forest in the Congo Basin (Eastern provinces and Ecuador), and savannah in the central highlands (Kasai), the most densely populated region in the country outside the conurbation of Kinshasa. Since the late nineteenth century, traditional ways of life have been changed due to colonization, struggles for independence, control over the country by Mobutu Sese Seko, and more recently the First and Second Congo War. Despite these influences, traditional customs and cultures of the Congo are largely preserved.

<h3>Peoples, Languages and Culture</h3>
<p>
- Pygmies, the first inhabitants of Congo, generally hunter-gatherers in the equatorial forest. Accustomed to a life in the wilderness, they usually are trading the products of the chase with the other tribes against the products of agriculture. They are increasingly involved in the Congolese society, losing some of their peculiarities;<br>
- Bantu, arrived in Congo in waves between -2000 and 500, from southern Nigeria. They are by far the largest group, and are mostly farmers. They are found throughout the country, and three of their four languages ??have the status of national language. It is Lingala, Kikongo and the Tshiluba. Kikongo is spoken by the Bakongo in the west, in the province of Bas-Congo and southern Bandundu. He was encouraged by the colonial administration as a lingua franca. We find traces of Kikongo in American descendants from slavery. For example, in the Gullah language of South Carolina that contains various elements Kikongo. Kikongo was originally spoken in the capital Kinshasa, but was supplanted by the Lingala, spoken along the middle reaches of the Congo River and all its tributaries. It is also the language traditionally used in the army, as well as traditional folk music (Papa Wemba, Koffi Olomide, Werrason, Ray Lema ...) whose production is centered in Kinshasa. The Tshiluba (or Chiluba and Luba-Kasai) is spoken in the Kasai region.<br>
- the East African brought the fourth national language, Kingwana - a dialect of Kiswahili. The East African Bantu are related to, but more likely to practice farming. They arrived in Congo in different territories (Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania), opportunities and times, and tensions with the Bantu are repeatedly manifested, especially in recent conflicts. <br>
- Hamites, from Darfur to South Sudan and Ethiopia, traditionally cattle. They include the Tutsis, the particularly large. Hamites also emigrated to Rwanda and Burundi at the same time. Is often mixed with Africans, they are found in the east and northeast of the country, and generally developed a culture and a more developed military organization. <br>

<p>
Congolese National Radio and Television, the public company is surrounded by other private companies in the audiovisual world Congolese since the liberalization of the 1990s. In Kinshasa, there are only fifty private Television channels. Other cities like Matadi, Lubumbashi, Mbuji-Mayi full of important television channels. Unlike national chain that aims to cover more or less throughout the territory, the private channels cover more local information. Since 2002, Radio Okapi, distributed over a large part of the Congolese territory has taken an important place among the mainstream media.

<h3>Sculture</h3>
<p>
As in all countries of Black Africa, sculpture tradition remains strong. The sculptures have always sponsors of secret societies, often for religious reasons.<br>
Many ancient works of Congolese traditional art were stolen during and after colonization. For example, the Museum of Tervuren in Belgium has several works in its collection, as the cup carrier. But there are also parts in English, American and Swiss museums. Some works of art belonging to private collectors as Ryckers family.<br>
The cup carrier is probably the most famous sculpture. It is the work of master Buli, ethnic Luba-hemba.<br>
